# BMC-Anvil

This GitHub Organization holds all repositories related to BareMetalCode's Anvil project.

## About

**BareMetalCode’s Anvil** is a project management tool as many others, with a twist…

The original purpose back in the day was to [build a showcase app](https://www.baremetalcode.com/bmc_showcase/).<br>
Eventually that demo evolved into a proper full-featured application.

As with the original app, this one too will follow the showcase approach in documentation concerns.<br>
I’ll do my best to publish companion notes to the [project's site](https://www.bmc-anvil.com/) for each module and feature in the application.

## Repository organization

Momentarily, GitHub does not support folders, therefore, nesting related repositories is not possible. A workaround is to use a
_pseudo-qualified-names_ approach by naming repositories like:<br>
`project.topic.subtopicA.suptopicB.xxx.actual_name_of_repo`

I'm not super happy though... it is organized, kind of weird to read...
